# Storywell (Android)
Storywell is a smartphone app for promoting physical activity in a family setting. When a family meets their activity goals, they will receive social rewards in the form of children's storybook chapters. The storybook chapters are supplemented with reflective questions to help families learn about factors that can help them to be active.
